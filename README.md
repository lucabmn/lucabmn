### 👋 Hi, I'm @lucabmn!

I'm an **IT Specialist for System Integration** with a passion for coding – day and night! 🚀

As a **Fullstack Developer**, I love building innovative web applications with **Next.js** and **tRPC**. **TypeScript** is my trusty companion. I also enjoy exploring the world of **Docker** to efficiently manage my projects.

**Current projects I'm working on:**

*   **[wavedesk](https://wavedesk.app/)** – A platform for managing your Microsoft 365 tenants.
*   **[weddingvault](https://weddingvault.de/)** – A platform allowing wedding guests to easily upload their photos from the event.

**My daily companions (work & leisure):**

*   ☀️ **Daytime:** `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`
*   🌙 **Nighttime:** `.java`, `.python`

*   ⚡ Fun Fact: I'm constantly on the lookout for the next exciting challenge and new technologies!
